# Compliance

## Data Collection

Any data we collect is used solely to improve the product. We do not sell, share, or monetise user data.

## Privacy by Design

Once funds are deposited into Silhouette's shielded infrastructure, your balances and trading activity are not visible to us or anyone else. This is enforced by the architecture itself, not by policy.

## Policy Engine Support

Silhouette supports programmable policy engines for compliance and access control. We'll be sharing more on this in the future.
