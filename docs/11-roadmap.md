Here is what to expect next:

- More pairs rolled out to the shielded feature. Community requests are welcome.
- HIP-3 markets support on the naked perps side.
- Shielded TWAP and VWAP order types as part of our iceberg suite.
- Request for Quote (RFQ) and Request for Match (RFM) infrastructure for larger workflows introduced. We’re looking for early users and market makers to test and shape this design. If that’s you, please reach out.
- Net Settlement layer for reduced price impact by furthering our shielded offering.
- While supported on day one of our launch, we will share more details on our policy engines and how they enable more use cases on-chain.
- Future releases will introduce deeper intent protection, more expressive order types, and fully confidential routing that still settles in public.
