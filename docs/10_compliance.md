Our compliance program is currently in development and subject to change.

## Data Collection

Any data we collect is used solely to improve the product. We do not sell, share, or monetise user data.

## Privacy by Design

Once funds are deposited into Silhouette's shielded infrastructure, your balances and trading activity are not visible to us or anyone else. This is enforced by the architecture itself, not by policy.

## Policy Engine Support

Silhouette will support policy engines at launch as part of our plan to introduce compliance into our system. While we are advocates of open finance principles, we also recognise the need to make crypto markets more accessible to the traditional financial world.
