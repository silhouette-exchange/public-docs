## Silhouette

Silhouette is a trading platform built on Hyperliquid that protects personal trade information, enabling the most sophisticated trading strategies to move freely onchain.

## The Exchange

Silhouette Exchange is the trading platform that protects personal trade information by enabling shielded order execution using it's own offchain matching engine held within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Designed for sophisticated traders and institutions, it leverages shielded tech coupled with Hyperliquid's liquidity to prevent front-running and strategy leakage, allowing users to move capital freely with best-in-class liquidity.

## The Desk

Silhouette Desk is the advanced Order and Execution Management System (OEMS) extension of the Silhouette Exchange, designed to replicate institutional trading workflows natively on-chain while preserving privacy and ensuring Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) settlement. Just as Talos and its peers provided institutions access to fragmented custodial and exchange liquidity, Silhouette Desk does the same for fragmented on-chain venues like Hyperliquid - aggregating multi-venue orders, enabling portfolio-level allocations.

By partnering with custodians like Talos, Fireblocks, and Anchorage, Silhouette Desk becomes the natural extension for institutional clients, allowing seamless capital deployment into DeFi and on-chain markets without disrupting existing custodial setups. This positions it as a key spot market launch enabler and RFQ powerhouse, fostering ecosystem overlap while protecting strategies from leakage in shielded environments.
