The purpose of your encryption key is to shield your Silhouette balances and trading activity from **everyone but you**.

The key is created in your browser and registered with the Silhouette contract using your EVM wallet. It is used by both the secure enclave and your browser to derive a shared secret which is used to encrypt your intents. **This key is not seen nor directly used by traders.**
