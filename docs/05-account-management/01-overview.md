To begin trading on Silhouette, a user first deposits assets to Silhouette on HyperCore. Next, is prompted to create a managed wallet for frictionless trading, as well as a unique encryption key to shield interactions. This managed wallet executes EVM transactions on a user's behalf. In total, there are three components relevant to a Silhouette account:
- Primary EVM wallet (managed by the trader, or Privy).
- Managed wallet (managed locally on a trader's device).
- Encryption key (managed locally on a trader's device).
