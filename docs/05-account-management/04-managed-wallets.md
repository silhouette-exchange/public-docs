These are ephemeral wallets that are created in traders' browsers to facilitate frictionless trading. They are registered with the Silhouette smart contract and are thereafter authorised to submit orders on behalf of traders' primary accounts.

Managed wallets may:
- Place orders
- Cancel orders
- Withdraw (to the primary EVM wallet only)
- Update their own registered metadata (e.g., associated friendly name or session expiry) with the Silhouette smart contract
