## Standard Fee Structure

When activated, Silhouette will operate on a volume-based tier system. Your tier is determined by your total trading volume over the trailing 30 days.

### Spot Trading Fees

| 30-Day Volume | Taker Fee | Maker Fee |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| ≤ $5M | 0.17% | 0.14% |
| > $5M to $25M | 0.16% | 0.13% |
| > $25M to $100M | 0.15% | 0.12% |
| > $100M to $500M | 0.14% | 0.11% |
| > $500M to $2B | 0.135% | 0.00% |
| > $2B to $7B | 0.13% | 0.00% |
| > $7B | 0.125% | 0.00% |

**Maker fees** are charged when you add liquidity to the order book by placing limit orders that don't immediately match.

**Taker fees** are charged when you remove liquidity from the order book by placing orders that match immediately.

At volume tiers above $500M, maker fees are eliminated entirely to incentivise deep liquidity provision.

## Why Fees Matter

Fees fund the infrastructure that keeps Silhouette operational: trusted execution environments, ongoing security audits, and platform development.

Unlike centralised venues, our fee structure is transparent from day one. You decide what the market learns from your trades. We're clear about what executing that discretion costs.
