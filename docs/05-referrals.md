## Introduction

At Silhouette, our referral program is designed to accelerate user growth and retention on our shielded exchange built on Hyperliquid. With a straightforward structure featuring flat rates and clear caps, it's easy to understand, predictable, and built to resist abuse. This system incentivizes sharing while ensuring long-term sustainability for the platform.

## Core Principles

Our referral program follows these key principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Flat rebate and discount rates make it accessible for all users.
2. **Growth-Focused**: Rewards onboarding and acquisition without unlimited entitlements.
3. **Fairness and Anti-Gaming**: Thresholds and caps prevent exploitation, ensuring genuine participation.
4. **Transparency**: Accrued rewards are securely stored and claimable via the front-end.

## How It Works

- **For Referrers**: Earn a share of the net trading fees generated by your referees. Rewards accrue to a secure contract accessible only by your wallet/account and can be claimed at any time.
- **For Referees**: Receive a discount on your trading fees when using a referral code during signup.
- **Caps**: Both rebates and discounts are limited by notional trade volume to keep the program focused on initial growth rather than perpetual benefits.
- **Activation**: Referrers must meet a minimum trading volume threshold to generate and share codes.

## Program Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Referrer Rebate Rate | 10% | Percentage of referee-generated fees shared with the referrer. |
| Referee Fee Discount | 5% | Discount applied to the referee's trading fees. |
| Referrer Volume Threshold | $10,000 notional | Minimum trading volume required to activate referral code generation. |
| Referrer Volume Cap | $1B notional (per referee) | Maximum volume on which a referrer earns rebates from a single referee. |
| Referee Discount Volume Cap | $25M notional | Maximum volume on which a referee receives the discount. |

## Anti-Gaming Measures

To maintain integrity:

- A volume threshold prevents easy creation of multiple accounts for self-referrals.
- Caps limit long-term exploitation.
- Ongoing monitoring and potential enhancements, like advanced detection, will be implemented based on usage data.

## Roadmap and Updates

We'll track metrics like referral-attributed volume and user retention, iterating as needed.
