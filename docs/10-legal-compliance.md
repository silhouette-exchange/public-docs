### Privacy Technology Disclaimer

## Regulatory Considerations

### Obfuscation vs. Regulatory Compliance

**Compliance Benefits of Obfuscation:**
- Maintains clear deposit/withdrawal audit trail
- Preserves ability to comply with legal requests
- Protects competitive trading information without hiding fund flows
- Enables regulatory-compliant privacy

### Jurisdictional Considerations

Users must consider their local regulations:

#### United States
- **FinCEN Guidance**: Privacy-preserving trading may fall under money services business regulations
- **SEC Considerations**: Securities trading regulations may apply to certain tokens
- **State Laws**: Individual states may have additional requirements
- **Tax Obligations**: All trades must be reported regardless of privacy features

#### European Union
- **MiCA Regulation**: Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation may apply
- **GDPR**: Data protection rights remain in effect
- **Anti-Money Laundering Directive**: AML requirements must be considered
- **Member State Laws**: Individual EU countries may have specific restrictions

#### Other Jurisdictions

- **Local Legal Advice**: Users should consult local legal counsel
- **Prohibited Uses**: Some countries may prohibit privacy-enhancing trading tools
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regulatory landscape changes frequently
