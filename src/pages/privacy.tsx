                  You can request corrections to your personal data held by the

                  disputed information.
                </li>

                  You may object to the processing of your personal data under
                  specific circumstances. Where the legal basis for our
                  processing of your personal data is our legitimate interest,
                  you have the right to object to such processing on grounds
                  relating to your particular situation. We will abide by your
                  request unless we have a compelling legal basis for the
                  processing which overrides your interests or if we need to

                  You can restrict the processing of your personal data to

                  You may opt out of marketing communications anytime by

                  You can withdraw your consent if the Company relies on it for
                  personal data processing; however, this won't impact the
                  processing of data carried out before the withdrawal or based

                consent, when necessary for the provision of the Website, or as
                otherwise allowed by law. In particular, your personal data may

                  transactions or reorganizations, we may disclose your personal

                countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic
                Area or Switzerland) or process personal data there, i.e.,
                countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to
                that of the EU or Switzerland.
              </p>
              <p>
                We safeguard your personal data per our contractual obligations

                data abroad.
              </p>

                  The transfer to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                  adequate level of protection according to the Federal Council,

              </ul>
              <p>
                If a third country transfer takes place and there is no adequacy
                decision or appropriate safeguards, it is possible and there is
                a risk that authorities in the third country (e.g. intelligence
                services) can gain access to the transferred data and that the
                enforceability of your data subject's rights cannot be

                Our Website contains links to websites or apps that are not
                operated by us. When you click on a third-party link, you will
                be directed to that third party's website or app. We have no

                We maintain online presences on social networks. If you have an
                account on the same network, it is possible that your
                information and media made available there may be seen by us,
                for example, when we access your profile. In addition, the
                social network may allow you to contact us. As soon as we
                transfer personal data into our own system, we are responsible
                for this independently. This is then done to carry out
                pre-contractual measures and to fulfil a contract. For the legal
                basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks
                under their own responsibility, please refer to their data
                protection declarations. Below is a list of social networks on
                which we operate an online presence:
