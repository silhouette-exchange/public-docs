                The Interface provides a means of easier access to a
                decentralised protocol on the Hyperliquid blockchain that allows
                users to trade certain digital assets ("Protocol"). The
                Interface generates draft transactions for the User which the
                User can then submit independently to the Protocol via its own
                third-party wallet application ("Wallet"). The User personally
                submits and approves all transactions sent via the Interface
                which are solely effected via the User's actions, and the User
                is solely responsible and liable for all activities conducted
                through the User's Wallet.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  the User independently decides to submit any draft

                  own Wallet;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the Company does not own, operate, control, or otherwise have
                  access to the User's funds, Wallet, or any related private
                  keys;
                </li>

                <li>
                  the Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning

                  cryptographic private keys to the User's Wallet;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the Company does not, and is not able to, check or otherwise
                  review the suitability of the trades made by the User via its
                  Wallet and is not responsible for the way the User uses the
                  Interface or the Protocol;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the use of the Interface is unsolicited and the User
                  independently decided to use the Interface;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the User has not received any investment advice from the

                <li>
                  neither the Interface, the Website, nor any information or

                  the Website may contain statements that constitute
                  "forward-looking statements." The Company is under no

                  market volatility, complete loss, operational risk, and
                  regulatory changes, and that the Company is not responsible
                  for any of these variables and risks; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  the User uses the Interface and the Website at its own risk.

                By accessing and using the Interface, the User represents being
                financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand
                the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
                blockchain-based systems, and having a working knowledge of the
                usage and intricacies of relevant digital assets. In particular,
                the User understands that blockchain-based transactions are
                irreversible and that the Company has no possibility whatsoever
                to influence or reverse any transactions submitted to the
                Protocol.
