static/                        # Static assets (images, etc.)
```

### Content Guidelines

#### Writing Style
- **Clear and concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **User-focused**: Write from the user's perspective
- **Consistent terminology**: Use the same terms throughout
- **Active voice**: Prefer active over passive voice
- **Inclusive language**: Use welcoming, inclusive language

#### Formatting Standards
- Use **Markdown** for all documentation files
- Follow the existing **heading hierarchy** (H1 for page titles, H2 for main sections, etc.)
- Use **code blocks** with appropriate language tags
- Include **alt text** for all images
- Use **relative links** for internal references

#### Technical Content
- **Test all code examples** before submitting
- **Include context** for technical concepts
- **Link to external resources** when helpful
- **Keep examples up-to-date** with current functionality

### Making Your Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
   Use descriptive branch names:
   - `docs/improve-trading-guide` for documentation improvements
   - `fix/broken-links` for bug fixes
   - `feature/new-faq-section` for new features

2. **Make your changes** following our guidelines

3. **Test your changes** locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

4. **Build the site** to check for errors:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: improve trading documentation clarity"
   ```

## üîÑ Submitting Your Contribution

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch** to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - **Clear title** describing your changes
   - **Detailed description** of what you've changed and why
   - **Screenshots** if you've made visual changes
   - **Reference to related issues** (if applicable)

3. **Preview your changes**: Once you create a PR targeting the `main` branch, Vercel will automatically generate a preview deployment. Look for the Vercel bot comment in your PR with a preview link like:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Preview deployment ready!
   üîç Preview: https://public-docs-git-your-branch-name-silhouette-exchange.vercel.app
   ```
   Use this preview link to:
   - **Test your changes** in a production-like environment
   - **Share with reviewers** for easier feedback
   - **Verify mobile responsiveness** and cross-browser compatibility
   - **Check that all links work** correctly

4. **Request review** from the documentation team

5. **Respond to feedback** from reviewers promptly, using the preview link to demonstrate fixes

6. **Merge** will be handled by maintainers after approval

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR**: Keep pull requests focused on a single improvement
- **Test with preview link**: Always check your Vercel preview before requesting review
- **Update documentation**: If you change functionality, update related docs
- **Test thoroughly**: Use the preview link to test across different browsers and devices
- **Follow existing patterns**: Match the style and structure of existing content
- **Be patient**: Reviews may take time, but we appreciate your contribution!

### Branch Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `docs/` - Documentation content changes
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `style/` - Styling and UI improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring without functional changes

Examples:
- `docs/update-account-management`
- `fix/mobile-navigation-issue`
- `feature/search-functionality`
- `style/improve-dark-mode`

## üîó Preview Deployments

Every pull request targeting the `main` branch automatically gets a preview deployment via Vercel:

### How It Works
- **Automatic**: Preview deployments are created automatically when you open a PR
- **Updated**: Each new commit to your PR branch updates the preview
- **Isolated**: Each PR gets its own unique preview URL
- **Production-like**: Previews use the same build process as the live site

### Using Preview Links
- **Test your changes** before requesting review
- **Share with others** for feedback and collaboration  
- **Verify responsive design** on different devices
- **Check performance** and loading times
- **Validate links** and navigation work correctly

### Preview Link Format
```
https://public-docs-git-[branch-name]-silhouette-exchange.vercel.app
```

The Vercel bot will comment on your PR with the exact preview URL once deployment is complete.
